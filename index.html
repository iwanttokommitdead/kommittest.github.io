        <div class="dualcontainer">
            <div class="dualsection">
                <h1>what do i even put here</h1>
                yknow, ive always wanted to make my own site with everything i ever need in there
                <br>instead of having separate pages like carrd, strawpage, toyhouse etc, id have this
                <br>plus THEY NEVER FIT!! theres always some STUPID FUCKING ELEMENTS LIMIT or it just WOULDNT FIT
                TO BE IN THE SITE or youd have to pay for a ficking Subscription.
                <br>
                <br>strawpage is cool though
                <br>thats my homie right there but I KEEP FORGETTING TO CHECK THAT SHIT
                <br>
                <br>i hope ill be able to *cough* *cough* <i>borrow</i> the code for the anon art and AMA
                <br>and besides isnt it cooler to have something you have full control over and whenever you wanna add
                more crap you can because ITS YOURS?^!?!?!?
                <br>
                <br>technically still aint mine because github BUT I CODED THIS SHIT. I DIDNT HAVE TO SUCCUMB TO SHITTY ASS
                DRAG AND DROP TEMPLATES.
                <br>
                <br>...
                <br>
                <br>I am talking to myself again i really hope no one visits the homepage before i delete it
                <br>but at the same time THIS IS <i>MY</i> SITE!!!
                <br>but  but    People., people are scary  I dont like it when i feel seen. 
            </div>

            <div class="dualsection">
                <h1>no but seriously what am i gonna write here</h1>
                mmmmmm i guess ill figure it out along the way
                <br>i oughta plan things out though or else id be wasting all this time spent on coding this
                <br>
                <br>okay so note for future me:
                <br>these two colums are flexible and stuff and equal height BUT NOT WIDTH and they would probably fit
                <br>as an about me/bio maybe
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>okay idea. fanart page. that would be so awesome.
                <br>
                <br>OH AND THE ADVENTURE MACHINE TOO!!!
                <br>
